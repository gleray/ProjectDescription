abstract = "This paper presents a summary of Demand Response (DR) in deregulated electricity markets. The definition and the classification of \{DR\} as well as potential benefits and associated cost components are presented. In addition, the most common indices used for \{DR\} measurement and evaluation are highlighted, and some utilities’ experiences with different demand response programs are discussed. Finally, the effect of demand response in electricity prices is highlighted using a simulated case study. "

@article{Chicco2006,
abstract = {The recent evolution of the electricity business reg- ulation has given new possibilities to the electricity providers for formulating dedicated tariff offers. A key aspect for building specific tariff structures is the identification of the consumption patterns of the customers, in order to formspecific customer classes containing customers exhibiting similar patterns. This paper illustrates and compares the results obtained by using various unsupervised clustering algorithms (modified follow-the-leader, hierarchical clustering, K-means, fuzzy K-means) and the self- organizing maps to group together customers with similar elec- trical behavior. Furthermore, this paper discusses and compares various techniques—Sammon map, principal component analysis (PCA), and curvilinear component analysis (CCA)—able to reduce the size of the clustering input data set, in order to allowfor storing a relatively small amount of data in the database of the distribution service provider for customer classification purposes. The effec- tiveness of the classifications obtained with the algorithms tested is compared in terms of a set of clustering validity indicators. Results obtained on a set of nonresidential customers are presented.},
